# tabl

Make tables from data in your terminal.

# Install

Download the latest from the [releases page](https://github.com/justone/tabl/releases).

# Usage

This small utility takes JSON or EDN files with multiple maps and creates a
table for ease of viewing. For example:

```
$ cat test.json
{"foo":"bar","baz":4}
{"foo":"oof","baz":4}
$ cat test.json | tabl -j
 :baz | :foo
------|------
 4    | bar
 4    | oof
```

There are several table rendering modes available:

| library                                            | modes               |
|----------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| [fancy](https://github.com/chbrown/fancy-clojure/) | fancy               |
| [doric](https://github.com/joegallo/doric)         | org, csv, html, raw |


```
$ cat test.json | tabl -j -m org
|-----+-----|
| Foo | Baz |
|-----+-----|
| bar | 4   |
| oof | 4   |
|-----+-----|
```

    * `render-table` - returns table as a list of strings
    * `print-table` - prints a table based on data
* `pod.tabl.doric`
    * `table` - returns table as a list of strings  (see [here](https://github.com/joegallo/doric) for more information)
